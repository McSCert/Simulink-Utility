% ISRANGEOVERLAP Detect whether or not the union of two ranges have an intersection.
%
%   Inputs:
%       range1  1x2 vector given with the lower value first.
%       range2  1x2 vector given with the lower value first.
%
%   Outputs:
%       bool    Logical true if the two ranges contain any common value
%               (including at the bounds).
