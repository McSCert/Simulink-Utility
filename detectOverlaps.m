function [overlap_exists, overlaps] = detectOverlaps(baseBlock, otherBlocks, varargin)
% DETECTOVERLAPS Detect whether a block physically overlaps any other block
% in Simulink.
%
% Inputs:
%   baseBlock   Simulink block. We're checking if any other block
%               overlaps this.
%   otherBlocks List (cell array or vector) of Simulink blocks (fullnames or
%               handles).
%   varargin	Parameter-Value pairs as detailed below.
%
% Parameter-Value pairs:
%   Parameter: 'OverlapType'
%   Value:  {'Vertical'} - Detects any overlap with respect to top and
%               bottom positions (i.e. blocks could be offset on the
%               x-axis, but still be deemed overlapping).
%           {'Horizontal'} - Detects any overlap with respect to left
%               and right positions (i.e. blocks could be offset on the
%               y-axis, but still be deemed overlapping).
%           {'Any'} - Detects blocks with either a vertical or
%               horizontal overlap.
%           {'All'} - (Default) Detects blocks sharing space.
%   Parameter: 'VirtualBounds'
%   Value:  Position vector to add to corresponding block dimensions.
%       Intended to make near overlaps also count as overlaps. Default:
%       [0 0 0 0].
%   Parameter: 'PositionFunction'
%   Value:  Takes a function handle that will be used to determine the
%       position of a given block. It may be desirable to use this to
%       make near overlaps also count as overlaps. Default is a
%       function that just runs get_param(block, 'Position').
%
% Outputs:
%   overlap_exists  True if any overlaps were detected.
%   overlaps        Vector of Simulink blocks in otherBlocks that
%                   overlap baseBlock.
